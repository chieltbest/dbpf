# Batl: Big Awful Texture Locator

Search for textures in packages which use a non-optimal format or which are too big for your liking.  
Since the Sims 2 and other games are 32-bit programs, they are limited to 4GiB of memory. Large textures will fill up
this memory more quickly, leading to problems such as the infamous pink flashing. Batl will help you find these textures
to (possibly
automatically in the future) convert these textures to a more suitable format or size.
